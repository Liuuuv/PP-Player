v0.0.2


New features:
- Added a reload button for the main playlist
- Added a settings button to update all the stored metadatas

Changes:
- The search bar of library>downloaded is now just above the display frame.
- Changed the way the main playlist is displayed to the same way as library>downloaded is: only the visible songs are rendered.
- Ajusted the logic behind the "scroll to current song" button
- Changed the sizes of thumbnails in the main playlist: Now they are all the same size : 80x45 (16:9)
- Now you need to open a menu with right click on a song in order to delete it (from a playlist or the device)
- Changed the horrible colors in the "errors" window.

Fixed issues:
- The right click on items in library>downloaded now works.
- Fixed the missalignment in library>downloaded and in library>playlists.
- Fixed the weird color changing when scrolling and hovering songs in the main playlist.
- Fixed the issue where YouTube results weren't showing because of lives showing.
- Fixed the issue where the YouTube results were showing if you untick and then tick the "Tracks" or the "Artists" button.
- Fixed the issue where "download_path.txt" was deleted when updating.


Known issues:
- The CPU usage is abnormally high sometimes when you're downloading all songs from an HTML page (liked videos/songs for example).
- The progress in the downloads tab looks bad under the texts.
- The scrollwheel doesn't work in the downloads tab.
- Some (not important) errors car occur during a download ("can't access the file because it's being use").
- The highlights in the artist page are not staying if you hover.
- The name of the artist takes too much space in the artist page.
- Search cache doesn't seem to work anymore.
- When closing an artist page, the song thumbnail is no longer visible. (to fix it, start a song and click on the cross that clears the search bar) This leads to a missing sliding panel.
